# Livestream Interactive Tool Description & Commands

Developed for the livestream at: https://kick.com/dualturbos  
Shorturl for this page: http://alturl.com/uvkip
## Description:  
Using chat commands to interact with a playable 3D environment that contains both the streamer's webcam and video content. Users can spawn objects in the 3D space from the Kick.com chat, change the video content, and other things. Heavily inspired by Valve's TF2 (one of my favorite games).

## Commands:
Video Control - control the video content:  
__!mute__ | __!unmute__ | __!pause__ | __!unpause__ | __!playat__ (number of seconds) | __!vol__ (0-10)  
  
Game Control - directly performs a game action:  
__!throw__ | __!other__  
  
Emoting - spawns a 3d character and performs the action:  
__!dance__ | __!lol__ | __!wow__ | __!omg__ | __!wtf__ | __!laugh__
